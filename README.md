## Philosophy

**A)** Users shouldn't have to learn many languages, tools and patterns to just start a simple project.

**B)** No dogmas (Functions vs Objects, Mutable vs Immutable, Monolith vs Micro-services, etc.).

**C)** _Example-driven development_ - No API changes without simple examples based on real-world needs.

**D)** No special terminology. Let's try to use words like _portal_, _hook_, _atom_ or _selector_ as little as possible because they have different meanings in different frameworks.

**E)** Don't build artificial barriers for users - if they want to use REST, CSS or SQL, don't try to stop them.

**F)** There is no silver bullet. However there should be a common denominator for most web projects.

**G)** There should be always a clear path forward for users. They will recognize when they need non-core tools and they will integrate them when needed, not before.

**H)** People make mistakes and things too complex. So linters, compilers, formatters and other tools should be as pedantic as possible. Ideally no configuration options for anything. Breaking changes are encouraged to reduce accidental complexity and technical debt.

## Non-Goals

**a)** Satisfy everybody.
**b)** Make the framework super-universal, i.e. natively support all use-cases, protocols and external services.
**c)** Don't change API, goals and features in the future.
**d)** Set and meet deadlines. It's done when it's done.
**e)** Deliver all features at once. Don't expect to deploy scalable realtime apps on a stable cloud with the first MoonZoon release.
