[MoonZoon](https://moonzoon.rs) is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) full-stack framework. If you want to read about new MZ features, architecture and interesting problems & solutions - Dev News is the right place.

# News

- Moon - [Warp](https://crates.io/crates/warp) replaced with [Actix](https://crates.io/crates/actix-web). There are API changes to allow you to use Actix directly from your apps.

- mzoon - Rewritten with Tokio, implemented `--open` parameter and `wasm-pack` installer.

- The entire MoonZoon codebase should be clean enough now. Comments are still missing and there should be more tests but if you wanted to know how it really works, you don't have to be afraid to read the code in the MZ [repo](https://github.com/MoonZoon/MoonZoon).

- You can select the required mzoon version for [heroku-buildpack-moonzoon](https://github.com/MoonZoon/heroku-buildpack-moonzoon) by adding the file [mzoon_commit](https://github.com/MoonZoon/demo/blob/main/mzoon_commit) to your repo with a MZ project.

You'll read about Moon and mzoon improvements in the following chapters. The last chapter is dedicated to my development fails, library fails and other notes from trenches.

And I would like to thank:
- All Rust libraries maintainers. It's tough work but it allows us to write clean code and amazing products.
