# MoonZoon Development
---

_WARNING:_ MoonZoon is in the phase of early development! You'll find hacks, ugly and spaghetti code in the repo!

But if you are brave enough:
```sh
cd examples
cd counter
cargo run --manifest-path "../../crates/mzoon/Cargo.toml" start
```
Then, you can find paths which trigger auto-reload in the file `examples/counter/MoonZoon.toml`.

And you can test it this way:
